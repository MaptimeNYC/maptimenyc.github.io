<p>The awesome thing about Maptime is there's like, a million amazing resources for learning about mapping and maps. The awesome thing about working on mapping stuff in New York is that there's also a ton of data resources for maps. Here's a list of both things! </p>

<h2>Useful NYC-Specific Resources</h2>
 
<ul>
<li>
	<p> <a href='http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/applbyte.shtml'>Bytes of the Big Apple</a>: Run by NYC's Department of City Planning, it mostly has a lot of the same datasets you can find on the Open Data Portal but usually has more detailed metadata for its datasets. This is where you can download <a href='http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/dwn_pluto_mappluto.shtml#mappluto'>MapPLUTO</a>! And <a href='http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/archive_pluto_mappluto.shtml'>historical MapPLUTO</a>! </p>
</li>

<li>
	<p><a href='https://nycopendata.socrata.com/'>NYC Open Data Portal</a>: The City of New York's Official open data portal--has a ton of datasets, some of which are honestly more useful than others. Disadvantages: usually limited metadata, harder to get context for a given dataset. Honestly, I tend to go to this site as a last resort. </p>
</li>
<li>
	<p> <a href='http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/CP/'>ACRIS</a>: also known as the Automated City Register Information System (ACRIS). A kind of clumsy to use resource for a deeper dive on real estate data for specific properties. Like all portals, it makes you kind of die inside, but it means well. </p>
</li>
<li>
	<p> <a href='http://spatialityblog.com/2010/07/08/mta-gis-data-update/'>The one MTA subway shapefile that, pretty much, everyone ends up finding via Google</a>). This was made by Steve Romulewski. All hail Steve. </p>
</li>
<li>
	<p> <a href='https://github.com/betanyc'>BetaNYC's Github</a>: BetaNYC is an open data, open government, and civic technology community group. They are a part of Code for America's brigade program and hosts useful datasets that might not be easily or immediately found on the city's open data portal. They also have a <a href='http://bit.ly/nyc-data-resources'>spreadsheet of data resources</a> that you might enjoy. You can learn more about getting involved with their meetups and at their <a href='http://www.meetup.com/betanyc/'>Meetup page</a> or check out their <a href='http://betanyc.us/#groups'>mailing lists and discussion groups</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
	<p><a href='http://web.mta.info/developers/'>MTA Developer Resources</a>: Pretty much what it sounds like. There's a variety of <a href='http://web.mta.info/developers/developer-data-terms.html#data'>real-time and static data feeds</a> including GTFS Schedule Data, bus and subway times, fare data, subway entry and exit spatial data, and turnstile usage data. </p>
</li>
<li>
	<p><a href='https://developer.cityofnewyork.us/api/geoclient-api'>NYC Geoclient API</a>: Also maintained by the Department of City Planning, the Geoclient API lets developers geocode using Geosupport, the city's in-house geocoder. </p>
</li>
<li>
	<p><a href='https://gis.ny.gov/'>NYS GIS Clearinghouse</a>: It's what it sounds like. Honestly, I still find this site really overwhelming and confusing and would love to spend more time actually looking at what's even there. </p>
</li>
<h2>Useful Mapping Resources: </h2>

<p>I mean, we could just send you to the <a href='http://www.maptime.io/lessons-resources/'>Maptime website</a> as a start. 
There's also this really great <a href='https://github.com/maptime/maptime/blob/master/tutorials.md'>list of tutorials</a> in the <a href='https://github.com/maptime'>Maptime github repository</a>.</p>
